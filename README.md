# Astragalus-Phylogenetics
Hello future Grillo Lab members, below I will document every step of the pipeline I used/created to process my Astragalus data. 
Most of the dependencies I used were already installed on the Smithsonian server I had access to for analyzing my data, therefore I will not be listing the steps to download and install these dependencies although, where possible, I will link the website to those tools where download information must be found. 

## Downloading data 
When data is uploading to NCBI I will link the projecct SRA accession number here
